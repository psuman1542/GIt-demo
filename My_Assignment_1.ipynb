        "  Linux is a Unix like Open Source Operating System(OS). It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 & first version of Linux kernel was released on September 17. The kernel is the core central program in Linux OS that manages communication between hardware and software. Kernel handles low-level tasks like processes, memory and device management. Everything in Linux OS is built upon kernal that includes utilities, system libraries & device drivers. Linux is very versatile and is widely used in cloud servers, web hosting and supercomputers. It also served as the foundation of Android OS running on smartphones. Linux is highly customizable. It offers a lot of flexibility & control to its users. It has wide variety of customizable versions called Linux Distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora etc.), each offering different default softwares & tools."
